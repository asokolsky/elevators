# Elevator simulator

This is a work in progress, not ready for a public review.

I wanted to:

* play with elevator simulation
* play with using FASTAPI for microservices

BTW [simpy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is awesome and is highly
recommended.  Not used in this project.

## Single Shaft

## Multiple Shafts
