# Simultons README

This is a work in progress, not ready for a public review.

I wanted to:

* play with elevator simulation
* play with using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for microservices

It also appeared that [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/) is a perfect fit to make
things work together.

BTW [simpy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is awesome and is highly
recommended.  It is NOT used in this project.

More [documents](./docs/).
