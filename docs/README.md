# Elevators README

## Domain Terminology

The building has multiple floors and >=1 elevator shaft(s).  Each floor has a
[floor panel](floor-panel.md) for calling an elevator.  Each elevator shaft
has a single [elevator](elevator.md).  There are [rider](rider.md)s who use
elevators by interacting first with a floor panel and then with the elevator
they ride.

## Simulation

There is a single [simulation](simulation.md) which provides context for
[simulton](simulton.md)s.

## Playing with it

For now, the play is limited to running unit tests.
